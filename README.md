# bankist
 Bankist is a fictitious, minimalist online banking web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) to simulate real-world financial management. Focused on user experience and DOM manipulation, it allows users to log in with a PIN, view transaction history, transfer money, request loans, and close accounts.
